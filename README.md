A Minecraft Java 1.8.9 Forge Mod, which shows you the current Bestiary of the Treasure Hunters or the Zealots in your HUD. Its a Mod I made for fun and because no one else had made such a feature. API key is not included and the uuid is from me. If you want to use it, you have to change the GuiOverlayHandler.java file.
